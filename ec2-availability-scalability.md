# EC2 High Availability and Scalability

## What is it?

- Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
- There are two kinds of scalability
  - Vertical
  - Horizonal (elasticity)

### Vertical Scalability

- Increases the size of an instance.
- E.g: application runs on t2.micro. We want to run it on t2.large.
- Common for non-distributed systems, such as a database
- E.g. RDS, Elasticache are services that can scale vertically
- Usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

### Horizontal Scalability

- Increase the number of instances/systems for an application.
- Instead of doubling the size of an instance, provision _another_ instance.
- Implies that systems are distributed.
- Common for web applications / modern applications.
- Easy to horizontally scale.

### High Availability

- Usually goes hand in ahnd with horizontal scaling.
- Running your application in at least 2 data centers (availability zones).
- The goal of high availability is to survive data center loss.
- Can be passive (RDS Multi AZ)
- Availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)

### For EC2

- Vertical Scaling: increase instance size
  - e.g. t2.nano 0.5GB, 1vCPU -> u-12tb1.metal - 12.3TB RAM, 448 vCPUs
  -
- Horizontal: Increase number of instances (aws terms = scale out or in)

  - Auto scaling group
  - Load balancer

- High Availability; Run instances for the same application across multiple AZs
  - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  - Load Balancer multi AZ

## Load Balancing

- Servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2s) downstream.
- Users initially connect to the load balancer. The load balancer redirects traffic between EC2 instances.

### Why use a load balancer?

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances.
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application.
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances.
- Do regular health checks to your instances.
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites.
- Enforce stickiness with cookies.
- High availability across zones.
- Can separate public traffic from private traffic.

There is an ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) called EC2 Load Balancer. This is a **managed load balancer**.

- AWS gauarantees that it will be working
- AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability.
- AWS provides only a few configuration knobs.

- Costs less to set up your own load balancer, but will be more effort for the SysAdmin.
- Integrated with many AWS offerings / services

### Load Balancers

AWS has 3 kinds of load balancers

- Classic Load Balancer (v1, 2009)
- Application Load Balancer (v2, 2016)
- Network Load Balancer (v2, 2017)
- Recommended to use v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features.
- You can setup internal and external load balancers

#### Health Checks

- Crucical for load balancers
- Enable load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are availabile to respond to requests
- The health check is done on a port and a route /health is common. **You** specify these parameters.
- Response is 200 for OK. If Response != 200, instance is unhealthy.

#### Application Load Balancer, ALB (v2)

- Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
- Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (e.g. containers)
- Load balancing based on route in URL
- Load balancing based on hostname in URL
- Great for micro services & container-based application (e.g. Docker, Amazon ECS)
- Has port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port.
- We would need to create a classic load balancer per application using the v1 LB.

Good to know:

- Stickiness can eb enabled at the target group level

  - Same request goes to same instance
  - Directly generated by ALB (not the application)
  - ALB support HTTP/HTTPS & Websockets protocols

- The application serevrs dont see the IP of the client directly
  - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
  - We can also get Port(X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)

#### Network Load Balancer, NLB (v2)

- Layer 4
- Forward TCP traffic to your instances
- Handle millions of requests per second
- Support for static IP or elastic IP
- Less latency (100ms vs 400ms for ALB)
- **Mostly used for extreme performance and should not be the default load balancer you choose.**
- Creation process is the same as the ALB.

Good to know:

- Classic LB is deprecated:
  - Use Application Load Balancers for HTTP / HTTPS & Websocket.
  - Use Network Load Balancer for TCP.
- CLB and ALB support SSL certificates andprovide SSL termination
- All LBs have health check capability
- ALB can route based on hostname / path
- ALb is great fit with ECS (Docker).
- Any LB has a static hostname. **Do not resolve and use underlying IP.** This is a common exam question
- LBs can scale but not instantaneously - contact AWS for a "warm-up"
- NLB directly see the client IP.
- 4xx errors are client induced errors.
- 5xx errors are application induced errors
  - 503 means the LB is at capacity, or no registered target is provided
- If the LB can't connect to your application, check your security groups!!

### Load Balancer Stickiness

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer.
- This works for both CLBs and ALBs.
- It works with cookies, which have an expiration date that you control.
- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose their session data.
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.

#### Elastic Load Balancers for SysOps

Application Load Balancer:
_ Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket)
_ URL based routing (hostname or path)
_ does not support static IP, but has fixed DNS.
_ Provide SSL termination.

Network Load Balancer:
_ Layer 4 (TCP)
_ No pre-warming needed for load balancer.
_ 1 static IP per subnet
_ So SSL termination (SSL must be enabled by the application itself)

Exam tip: Chain a NLB and an ALB together to give the ALB a fixed IP.

Pre-warming

- ELB scale gradually to traffic
- ELB may fail in case of sudden spike of traffic (10x traffic)
- If you expect high traffic, open a support ticket with AWS to pre-warm your ELB. This means scaling up your ELB in advance.
  - Duration of traffic
  - Expected requests per second
  - Size of requests (in KB)

Error Codes

- **200 - successful request** <-
- **4xx - unsuccessful at client side** <-
  - 400 - bad request
  - 401 - unauthorised
  - 403 - forbidden
  - 460 - client closed connection
  - 463 - X-Forwarded For header with >30 IP (similar to malformed request)
- 5xx- unsuccessful at server side
  - 500 - internal server error (error on ELB)
  - 502 - bad gateway
  - **503 - Service unavailable** <-
  - 504 - gateway timeout, probably an issue within the server
  - 561 - unauthorised

<- need to know for exam

Supporting SSL for Old Browsers

**Common question:**
How do we support legacy browsers that have an old TLS (TLS 1.0)?

Answer: change the policy to allow for weaker cipher e.g. DES-CBC3-SHA

Only a very small % of the internet uses TLS 1.0
ELB provides security policies for ALB

### LB common troubleshooting

- Check security groups on LB and EC2.
- Check health checks.
- Sticky sessions may bring imbalance on the LB side.
- For multi-az load balancing, ensure cross zone balancing is enabled (classic load balancer)
- Internal load balancer for private applications that don't need public access.
- Enable Deletion Protection to prevent against accidental deletes.
  - Go to LB -> scroll down to Attributes. Enable Delete Protection.
